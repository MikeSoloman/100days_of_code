The idea of this 100 days code challange was take from
my Udemy instructor Dr. Angela Yu, here is the link for her Udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The idea of 100 days of Code is simple:
start from basics of Python syntax, and
keep adding more and more complex code.

I believe that I already have great skills in Python, 
but practice makes it better, so I have decided to start this challenge on 
December 31st, 2021.....

New Year, New Goals :)

Happy Coding :)
